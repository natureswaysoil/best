## Deployment Requirements

### Video File Organization
Current structure: `/public/videos/NWS_XXX.{mp4,webm,jpg}`
Target structure for main website: `/videos/NWS_XXX.{mp4,webm,jpg}`

### Missing Components Requiring Action
1. **Product Images**: Need to source 15+ product images from Amazon
2. **Hero Video**: Main homepage video (referenced in videos/README.md)
3. **Captions**: VTT subtitle files for accessibility

### Deployment Targets
1. **Primary**: Main website repository (natureswaysoil.github.io)
2. **Alternative**: Direct Vercel deployment
3. **Backup**: Current dashboard location with asset links

## Size Optimization Opportunities
- WebM files are ~40% larger than MP4 equivalents
- Consider using only MP4 for broad compatibility
- Thumbnail JPGs are well-optimized at ~30-35KB each

## Recommended Deployment Strategy
1. Create deployment script to sync `/public/videos/` to main website
2. Preserve file structure for product pages integration
3. Add missing product images from Amazon sources
4. Test video playback on main website after deployment
5. Update any hardcoded asset URLs in main website code
