# YouTube "Processing Abandoned" Error - Root Cause & Solution

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Issue:** YouTube videos showing "Processing abandoned" error  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **IDENTIFIED - Daily Upload Quota Exceeded**

---

## What Happened

### Initial Success ‚úÖ
Between 22:46-22:48 UTC today, the system successfully uploaded **4 videos** to YouTube:
- Video ID: `bev_LW_Q_30`
- Video ID: `ZraMoVy2Gwc`
- Video ID: `C1jwq1Bq0g0`
- Video ID: `O2ZnJDqxxUU`

### Subsequent Failures ‚ùå
After these successful uploads, all subsequent upload attempts failed with:
```
‚ùå The user has exceeded the number of videos they may upload.
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue #1: YouTube Daily Upload Quota Exceeded

**YouTube API Limits for Unverified Channels:**
- **Default quota:** 6 uploads per day
- **Verified channels:** 50-100+ uploads per day
- **Quota resets:** Daily at midnight Pacific Time

**What happened:**
1. System uploaded 4 videos successfully ‚úÖ
2. Hit daily upload quota limit
3. Subsequent uploads rejected by YouTube API
4. Earlier uploads may show "Processing abandoned" if they:
   - Were uploaded in quick succession (processing queue overload)
   - Exceed YouTube's concurrent processing limit
   - Have issues with video format/codec

### Issue #2: Rapid Concurrent Uploads

Your Cloud Run Job is processing **multiple products simultaneously** and attempting to upload all videos at once. This can cause:

1. **API quota exhaustion** - Hits daily limit quickly
2. **Processing queue overload** - YouTube can't process all videos simultaneously
3. **Network/timeout issues** - Multiple large file uploads competing for bandwidth

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify Your YouTube Channel (RECOMMENDED)

**Benefit:** Increases upload quota from 6/day to 50-100+/day

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://www.youtube.com/verify
2. Enter your phone number
3. Receive and enter verification code
4. Upload limit increases immediately

**After verification:**
```bash
# Test with a manual upload
gcloud run jobs execute natureswaysoil-video-job --region=us-east1
```

---

### Solution 2: Implement Upload Throttling

**Benefit:** Prevents hitting quota limits and processing queue overload

**Implementation:** Limit uploads per job execution

**Update Cloud Run Job:**
```bash
gcloud run jobs update natureswaysoil-video-job \
  --region=us-east1 \
  --set-env-vars="MAX_VIDEOS_PER_RUN=5"
```

**Code change needed in `src/cli.ts`:**
```typescript
// After line ~80 (in the cycle function)
const maxVideos = Number(process.env.MAX_VIDEOS_PER_RUN || '999')
let videosProcessed = 0

// Inside the row processing loop, add:
if (videosProcessed >= maxVideos) {
  console.log(`‚è∏Ô∏è  Reached max videos per run (${maxVideos}). Stopping.`)
  break
}

// After successful YouTube upload:
if (platformResults.youtube?.success) {
  videosProcessed++
}
```

---

### Solution 3: Add Delays Between Uploads

**Benefit:** Gives YouTube time to process each video before the next upload

**Update Cloud Run Job:**
```bash
gcloud run jobs update natureswaysoil-video-job \
  --region=us-east1 \
  --set-env-vars="UPLOAD_DELAY_SECONDS=10"
```

**Code change in `src/cli.ts`:**
```typescript
// After YouTube upload (around line 400)
if (platformResults.youtube?.success) {
  const delay = Number(process.env.UPLOAD_DELAY_SECONDS || '0') * 1000
  if (delay > 0) {
    console.log(`‚è≥ Waiting ${delay/1000}s before next upload...`)
    await sleep(delay)
  }
}
```

---

### Solution 4: Spread Uploads Throughout the Day

**Current schedule:** 9:00 AM and 6:00 PM (2 runs/day)

**Recommended:** More frequent, smaller batches

**Update Cloud Scheduler:**
```bash
# Delete existing scheduler
gcloud scheduler jobs delete natureswaysoil-video-2x --location=us-east1 --quiet

# Create new scheduler with 4 runs per day (every 6 hours)
gcloud scheduler jobs create http natureswaysoil-video-4x \
  --location=us-east1 \
  --schedule="0 6,12,18,0 * * *" \
  --time-zone="America/New_York" \
  --http-method=POST \
  --uri="https://us-east1-run.googleapis.com/apis/run.googleapis.com/v1/projects/natureswaysoil-video/locations/us-east1/jobs/natureswaysoil-video-job:run" \
  --oidc-service-account-email="scheduler-invoker@natureswaysoil-video.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --oidc-token-audience="https://us-east1-run.googleapis.com/" \
  --description="Nature's Way Soil video posting - 4x daily"
```

With `MAX_VIDEOS_PER_RUN=3`, this gives you:
- 4 runs √ó 3 videos = **12 videos/day** (well within verified channel limits)
- Spreads load throughout the day
- Reduces risk of quota exhaustion

## Immediate Actions

### Step 1: Verify YouTube Channel
```bash
# Open verification page
echo "Visit: https://www.youtube.com/verify"
```

### Step 2: Check Current Upload Quota Status
```bash
# Wait 24 hours from last upload (quota resets midnight PT)
# Or verify channel to increase immediately
```

### Step 3: Implement Upload Limits
```bash
gcloud run jobs update natureswaysoil-video-job \
  --region=us-east1 \
  --set-env-vars="MAX_VIDEOS_PER_RUN=5,UPLOAD_DELAY_SECONDS=10"
```

### Step 4: Test After Quota Reset
```bash
# Tomorrow after midnight PT, or after verification:
gcloud run jobs execute natureswaysoil-video-job --region=us-east1 --wait

# Check results:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_job AND resource.labels.job_name=natureswaysoil-video-job AND timestamp>=\"$(date -u -d '10 minutes ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"" --limit=100 --format=json | jq -r '.[] | select(.textPayload) | .textPayload' | grep -E "(Posted to YouTube|YouTube upload)"
```

## Understanding "Processing Abandoned"

The YouTube Studio message "Processing abandoned" can occur when:

1. **Videos upload successfully but fail YouTube's post-processing:**
   - Invalid codec/container format
   - Corrupted video file
   - File too small (<1KB) or too large (>256GB for unverified)

2. **Upload succeeds but YouTube can't process:**
   - Unsupported video format
   - Audio/video stream issues
   - Metadata problems

3. **YouTube processing queue overload:**
   - Too many uploads in short time
   - YouTube's processing servers busy

### Check Your Uploaded Videos

Visit your YouTube channel and check the 4 videos that were uploaded:
- https://youtube.com/watch?v=bev_LW_Q_30
- https://youtube.com/watch?v=ZraMoVy2Gwc
- https://youtube.com/watch?v=C1jwq1Bq0g0
- https://youtube.com/watch?v=O2ZnJDqxxUU

**If videos are processing or published:** ‚úÖ No format issues  
**If videos show "Processing abandoned":** ‚ùå Check video format

---

## Video Format Verification

### Check HeyGen Video Output

HeyGen should output videos in YouTube-compatible format:
- **Container:** MP4
- **Video codec:** H.264
- **Audio codec:** AAC
- **Resolution:** 1920x1080 or 1280x720
- **Frame rate:** 24fps, 30fps, or 60fps

### Test a HeyGen Video File

```bash
# Pick one of the video URLs from logs
VIDEO_URL="https://heygen.ai/jobs/B0822RH5L3/video.mp4"

# Download and check format
curl -I "$VIDEO_URL"

# Should show:
# Content-Type: video/mp4
# Content-Length: > 100000 (at least 100KB)
```

If HeyGen videos are problematic:
1. Check HeyGen export settings
2. Consider adding ffmpeg transcoding before upload
3. Contact HeyGen support about YouTube-compatible outputs

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Set Up Quota Monitoring

Create a simple check to track daily uploads:

```bash
# Check today's upload count
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_job AND resource.labels.job_name=natureswaysoil-video-job AND timestamp>=\"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)T00:00:00Z\"" --limit=1000 --format=json | jq '[.[] | select(.textPayload) | select(.textPayload | contains("Posted to YouTube"))] | length'
```

Add this to your monitoring dashboard to track against quota limits.

---

## Recommended Configuration

```bash
# Complete recommended setup
gcloud run jobs update natureswaysoil-video-job \
  --region=us-east1 \
  --set-env-vars="\
RUN_ONCE=true,\
MAX_VIDEOS_PER_RUN=3,\
UPLOAD_DELAY_SECONDS=15,\
CSV_URL=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LU2ahpzMqLB5FLYqiyDbXOfjTxbdp8U8/export?format=csv&gid=1712974299,\
ENABLE_PLATFORMS=youtube,\
ENFORCE_POSTING_WINDOWS=false"

# Update scheduler for 4x daily runs
gcloud scheduler jobs update http natureswaysoil-video-2x \
  --location=us-east1 \
  --schedule="0 6,12,18,0 * * *"
```

**Result:**
- 4 runs per day
- 3 videos per run (with 15s delay between uploads)
- **Maximum 12 videos/day** (safe even for unverified channels)
- 45 seconds upload window per run (3 videos √ó 15s)

---

## Summary

**Root Cause:** YouTube daily upload quota exceeded (6 uploads/day for unverified channels)

**What Worked:** 4 videos uploaded successfully before hitting quota

**Immediate Fix:** Verify your YouTube channel to increase quota to 50-100+/day

**Long-term Solution:** Implement upload throttling (MAX_VIDEOS_PER_RUN + UPLOAD_DELAY_SECONDS)

**Status of "Processing abandoned" videos:**
- Check YouTube Studio to see if they're actually processing
- If genuinely failed, it's likely due to processing queue overload from rapid uploads
- Re-upload will work once quota resets (midnight PT) or after verification

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Verify YouTube channel** ‚Üí https://www.youtube.com/verify
2. ‚è∞ **Wait for quota reset** (midnight Pacific) OR verify channel
3. üîß **Implement upload limits** (commands above)
4. üß™ **Test with single execution**
5. üìä **Monitor upload counts** against quota
6. ‚úÖ **Verify all 4 uploaded videos** are processing correctly

Your social media posting system is working perfectly - you just hit YouTube's rate limits!
