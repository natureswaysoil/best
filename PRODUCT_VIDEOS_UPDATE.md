## Technical Changes

### Fixed Serialization Issue
- Updated `/pages/product/[id].tsx` to properly handle optional fields (`originalPrice` and `video`)
- Used spread operators to only include fields when they have actual values
- This fixed Next.js build errors related to `undefined` not being serializable

### Product Detail Component
- Already had full video support with controls (play/pause, mute/unmute)
- Video displays in the main image area
- Video thumbnail shows in image carousel
- Professional video player with proper controls

## How Videos Work

1. **Video Display**: When a product has a `video` property, a video thumbnail appears in the image carousel
2. **Video Playback**: Clicking the video thumbnail switches to video mode with full controls
3. **Video Controls**: Users can play/pause and mute/unmute the video
4. **Fallback**: If no video is available, the product page works perfectly with just images

## Video URLs

All videos are hosted on AWS CloudFront CDN:
- Base URL: `https://d3uryq9bhgb5qr.cloudfront.net/`
- Format: MP4 with H.264 codec
- Optimized for web playback
- Professional quality product demonstrations

## Build Status

✅ **Build Successful**: All 12 products build without errors
✅ **Dev Server Running**: http://localhost:3003
✅ **Static Generation**: All product pages pre-render correctly
✅ **ISR Enabled**: Pages revalidate every 3600 seconds (1 hour)

## Testing

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3003/shop
2. Click on any product (especially NWS_001, NWS_004, NWS_006, NWS_012, or NWS_018)
3. On the product detail page, look for the video thumbnail in the image carousel
4. Click the video thumbnail to watch the product video
5. Use the play/pause and mute/unmute controls

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add More Videos**: Create videos for remaining 7 products
2. **Optimize Images**: Download and optimize product images locally for faster loading
3. **Add Video Captions**: Include .vtt caption files for accessibility
4. **Hero Video**: Add the hero video to `/public/videos/website-hero.mp4`
5. **Product Photography**: Consider adding more product images for the carousel
