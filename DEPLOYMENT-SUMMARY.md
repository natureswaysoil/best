## 🔍 Post-Deployment Verification

### Test These URLs:
1. **Primary Video**: https://www.natureswaysoil.com/videos/NWS_001.mp4
2. **WebM Format**: https://www.natureswaysoil.com/videos/NWS_001.webm  
3. **Thumbnail**: https://www.natureswaysoil.com/videos/NWS_001.jpg
4. **Dashboard**: https://www.natureswaysoil.com/dashboard/

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Videos should play in browser
- ✅ Thumbnails should display  
- ✅ Dashboard should load with charts
- ✅ No 404 errors for any asset URLs

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If Videos Don't Load:
1. **Check file permissions**: Ensure web server can read files
2. **Verify MIME types**: Server should recognize .mp4 and .webm
3. **Clear CDN cache**: If using Cloudflare/similar, purge cache
4. **Test direct URLs**: Access video URLs directly in browser

### Common Issues:
- **403 Forbidden**: File permission issue
- **404 Not Found**: Incorrect deployment path  
- **Slow loading**: Large file size (current files are optimized)
- **No video controls**: Browser compatibility or MIME type issue

## 📈 Integration with Main Website

### For Product Pages:
Update your product pages to reference videos:
```html
<video poster="/videos/NWS_001.jpg" controls>
  <source src="/videos/NWS_001.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="/videos/NWS_001.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

### For Dashboard Integration:
- Alternative dashboard available at `/dashboard/`
- Simplified version of the main PPC dashboard
- No BigQuery integration (static charts only)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy the package** using your preferred method above
2. **Test all video URLs** to ensure proper deployment
3. **Update product pages** to include video players
4. **Consider CDN setup** for faster global video delivery
5. **Monitor bandwidth usage** (6.5MB × page views)

## 📊 Asset Performance Optimization

**Current Status**: Videos are already optimized
- MP4 files: ~200-230KB (excellent compression)
- WebM files: ~280-320KB (good compression, modern browsers)
- Thumbnails: ~30-37KB (optimal web size)

**Future Optimizations**:
- Consider progressive JPEG for thumbnails
