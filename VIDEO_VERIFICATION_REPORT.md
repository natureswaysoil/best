## Video Generation Process

Videos are generated using `scripts/generate-product-videos.mjs` which:

1. Reads ASIN-specific scripts from `content/video-scripts/asin-scripts.json`
2. Generates 30-second videos with timed text overlays
3. Applies Ken Burns effect on product posters
4. Outputs MP4 (H.264), WebM (VP9), and JPG poster for each product
5. Places files in `/public/videos/{PRODUCT_ID}.[mp4|webm|jpg]`

## Product Data Configuration

All products in `data/products.ts` have correct video references:
```typescript
video: '/videos/NWS_001.mp4',
videoWebm: '/videos/NWS_001.webm',
videoPoster: '/videos/NWS_001.jpg'
```

## Component Implementation

`components/ProductDetail.tsx` properly handles video display:
- Direct video embedding (no thumbnail gallery needed)
- Auto-play with muted start
- Full playback controls
- Professional styling with black background
- Product Video badge for identification
- Fallback to image display when video unavailable

## Accessibility & User Experience

✅ Muted auto-play respects user preferences
✅ Cross-browser compatibility (MP4 + WebM)
