# Product Detail Video Enhancement - Completed

## Date
October 22, 2025

## Objective
Fix the product detail page to ensure videos created using HEYGEN avatars are embedded directly into the page, removing the three thumbnails and making videos more prominent with product benefits and usage instructions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Thumbnail Navigation
- **Before**: Product detail pages showed 3 thumbnails at bottom (image thumbnails + video thumbnail with play icon)
- **After**: All thumbnails removed - videos now embedded directly in main display area

### 2. Direct Video Embedding
- Videos now display immediately when page loads (no need to click thumbnail)
- Videos use aspect-video (16:9) ratio for optimal viewing
- Black background for professional video presentation
- "Product Video" badge added in top-left corner for clear identification

### 3. Enhanced Video Controls
- **Auto-play**: Videos start playing automatically (muted for better UX)
- **Play/Pause Button**: Fully functional with clear visual feedback
- **Mute/Unmute Button**: Toggle sound on/off with volume icons
- **Improved Styling**: Buttons have shadow effects for better visibility

### 4. Product Information Display
Videos are accompanied by comprehensive product information:
- **Description**: Full product description above the fold
- **Key Features**: Bullet list of product benefits (8 items per product)
- **How to Use**: Step-by-step usage instructions (4 steps per product)

### 5. Video Content
All 12 products have videos with:
- Product name and benefits explained by HeyGen avatar
- Professional voiceover describing features
- Usage instructions and application tips
- Duration: 15-30 seconds each
- Formats: MP4 (primary) and WebM (fallback)
