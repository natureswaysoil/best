## 🧪 Automation Testing & Validation

The project ships with a dry-run friendly verification suite covering data integrity, script templates, HeyGen readiness, and social media automation. No additional dependencies are required—everything runs through Node.js.

### Quick validation commands

```bash
# Validate environment configuration and filesystem prerequisites
npm run validate

# Run fast, offline-friendly checks for data and templates
npm run test:all
```

### Individual component checks

```bash
npm run test:csv        # Ensure product data and video assets are in sync
npm run test:openai     # Validate script templates and timing windows
npm run test:heygen     # Confirm HeyGen integration scaffolding and fallbacks
npm run test:platforms  # Inspect social automation server and credential coverage
```

### Full workflow verification

```bash
npm run test:e2e:dry    # Sequentially run all suites without requiring API credentials
npm run test:e2e        # Full verification (expects HeyGen + platform environment variables)
```

Each script prints detailed success, failure, and skip summaries so you can quickly address configuration gaps before deployment.
